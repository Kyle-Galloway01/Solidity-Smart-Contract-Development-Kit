## Token Contract (Token.sol)

### Overview
The Token contract is an ERC-20 compatible token contract that allows users to create and manage their own tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Functions

#### Constructor
- **Description:** Initializes the token contract with the provided name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply.
- **Parameters:**
  - `_name`: Name of the token.
  - `_symbol`: Symbol of the token.
  - `_decimals`: Number of decimal places for the token.
  - `_initialSupply`: Initial supply of tokens.
- **Usage:** Deploy the contract and provide the required parameters to initialize it.

#### Transfer
- **Description:** Transfers tokens from the sender's account to the specified recipient.
- **Parameters:**
  - `_to`: Address of the recipient.
  - `_value`: Amount of tokens to transfer.
- **Usage:** Call the transfer function with the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to transfer.

#### Approve
- **Description:** Approves another address to spend tokens on behalf of the sender.
- **Parameters:**
  - `_spender`: Address to approve.
  - `_value`: Amount of tokens to approve.
- **Usage:** Call the approve function with the spender's address and the amount of tokens to approve.

#### TransferFrom
- **Description:** Transfers tokens from one address to another on behalf of the sender.
- **Parameters:**
  - `_from`: Address from which to transfer tokens.
  - `_to`: Address to which to transfer tokens.
  - `_value`: Amount of tokens to transfer.
- **Usage:** Call the transferFrom function with the sender's address, recipient's address, and the amount of tokens to transfer.

### Events
- **Transfer:** Emitted when tokens are transferred from one address to another.
- **Approval:** Emitted when approval is granted for one address to spend tokens on behalf of another.

### Security Considerations
- Access control mechanisms are implemented to restrict sensitive functions and ensure proper authorization.
- Security best practices are followed to mitigate risks such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and unauthorized access.

### Integration Guide
- Integrate the Token contract with frontend applications using web3.js or ethers.js.
- Use the provided ABI to interact with the contract functions and events.
- Refer to the provided examples and code snippets for guidance on integrating the contract with frontend applications.

## Token Sale Contract (TokenSale.sol)

### Overview
The TokenSale contract facilitates token sales (initial coin offerings) and distributes tokens to investors.

### Functions

#### Constructor
- **Description:** Initializes the token sale contract with the provided Token contract address and token price.
- **Parameters:**
  - `_tokenContract`: Address of the Token contract.
  - `_tokenPrice`: Price of each token in wei.
- **Usage:** Deploy the contract and provide the address of the Token contract and the token price.

#### BuyTokens
- **Description:** Allows buyers to purchase tokens by sending Ether to the contract.
- **Parameters:**
  - `_numberOfTokens`: Number of tokens to purchase.
- **Usage:** Send Ether to the contract's buyTokens function with the desired number of tokens to purchase.

#### EndSale
- **Description:** Ends the token sale and transfers remaining tokens back to the owner.
- **Usage:** Call the endSale function to end the token sale and transfer remaining tokens back to the owner.

### Events
- **Sell:** Emitted when tokens are sold to a buyer.

### Security Considerations
- Access control mechanisms are implemented to restrict sensitive functions and ensure proper authorization.
- Security best practices are followed to mitigate risks such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and unauthorized access.

### Integration Guide
- Integrate the TokenSale contract with frontend applications using web3.js or ethers.js.
- Use the provided ABI to interact with the contract functions and events.
- Refer to the provided examples and code snippets for guidance on integrating the contract with frontend applications.

## Voting System Contract (VotingSystem.sol)

### Overview
The VotingSystem contract enables on-chain voting processes, such as elections or governance proposals.

### Functions

#### Vote
- **Description:** Allows voters to cast their votes for a candidate.
- **Parameters:**
  - `_candidate`: Identifier of the candidate for whom to cast the vote.
- **Usage:** Call the vote function with the identifier of the candidate for whom to cast the vote.

#### GetVoteCount
- **Description:** Retrieves the number of votes received by a candidate.
- **Parameters:**
  - `_candidate`: Identifier of the candidate.
- **Usage:** Call the getVoteCount function with the identifier of the candidate to retrieve the number of votes received.

### Events
- **VoteCast:** Emitted when a voter casts their vote for a candidate.

### Security Considerations
- Access control mechanisms are implemented to restrict sensitive functions and ensure proper authorization.
- Security best practices are followed to mitigate risks such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and unauthorized access.

### Integration Guide
- Integrate the VotingSystem contract with frontend applications using web3.js or ethers.js.
- Use the provided ABI to interact with the contract functions and events.
- Refer to the provided examples and code snippets for guidance on integrating the contract with frontend applications.
